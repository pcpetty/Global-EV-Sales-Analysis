# Global EV Sales Analysis: 2010-2024

This project analyzes the global sales and adoption trends of Electric Vehicles (EVs) from 2010 to 2024. The analysis explores the distribution of EV stock share and sales across different regions and powertrain types, providing insights into the evolving landscape of the global EV market.

## Project Overview

Electric Vehicles (EVs) are transforming the transportation sector, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. This project delves into the global EV market, highlighting key trends and insights:

- **Regional Comparison**: Identify leading and lagging regions in EV adoption.
- **Powertrain Analysis**: Examine the growth of different EV powertrain types (BEV, PHEV, etc.) over time.
- **Trend Analysis**: Analyze year-over-year growth rates in EV stock and sales share.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [International Energy Agency (IEA) - Global EV Data 2024](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/global-ev-outlook-2024#global-ev-data). It includes historical data on EV stock share, sales, and other relevant metrics across various regions and powertrain types.
